Producer namespace:
    /eshop/cardchecker

Thunk namespace
    /eshop/cardchecker/results/<auto_incrementing_number>

Consumer namespace
    /pos/device1/cardchecker/inputs/<auto_incrementing_number>

Pseudocode
-------------------------------------

Concept
    Execute C++ code and provide credit card number as input
    "GOOD" or "BAD" printed to screen

Consumer
    Does basic CC checking (is it all digits, is it between 12-19 digits)
    Publish CC# to pos1/cardchecker/inputs/<auto_incrementing_number>
    Send Notification Interest to /eshop/cardchecker
        Signed by API KEY
        Contains Parameter for Forwarding Hint to pos1/cardchecker/inputs/<auto_incrementing_number>
    Receive Positive response from Producer for Notification
    Receive Data from Producer for CC#
        Signed by Producer KEY
        Contains Parameter for Forwarding Hint to /eshop/cardchecker/results/auto_incrementing_number
    Send Interest to return result
        If result ready, receive Data right away with a positive status message
        Else if result not ready, Producer will send Data pointing to a new thunk

Producer
    Listening on /eshop/cardchecker
    Receive notification interest, and check that signed by API KEY. Return positive data response
    Send interest to parameter from above, now as forwarding Hint
        Include thunk name where result will be stored as parameter
        Publish thunk name for listening
    Receive data and execute desired CC# Checking Function
    Upon Interest receipt for final result, return
